# Final-Project
Can factors x,y,z related to alcohol consumption predict happiness?
    happiness = output column, exclude from clustering
    List of variables 
    What is the most predictive variable?
    Linear regression
    Clusters would help define subgroups that are potentially related to happiness

## Data Sources:
Kaggle datasets pulled from GHO (Global Health Observatory) and WHO (World Health Organization), GWP (Gallup World Poll):
World Alcohol Consumption - https://www.kaggle.com/codebreaker619/alcohol-comsumption-around-the-world
2020 World Happiness - https://www.kaggle.com/londeen/world-happiness-report-2020
Life Expectancy - https://www.kaggle.com/augustus0498/life-expectancy-who

## Tasks:
Question

Combine data sets - Jupyter notebook, join by country
Understand what the variables are
Linear regression model
    compare 2 columns, would happiness always be one of the comparison columns?
    slope tells you how related 2 columns are
Cluster analysis - comparing any 2 columns together to see if there is correlation by grouping
    compare 2 columns - form clusters, then look at happiness
